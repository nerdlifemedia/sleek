John Rodriguez started gaming on computers at a young age and was instantly fascinated with how computer games were created from code. In college He learned the basics of a few languages vb.NET, c++, java and javascript. While in school he also started with to play around with some html and created a few sites in the early 2000's when iframes were cool, but around that time He couldn't fhend a job as a programmer since most companies were looking for senior level experience. Instead he got a job in computer networking towards the end of college. After a few years in the IT sector, a job position for application developer opened up at my employer. He went for it and got the position, I started programing in vb.net and in 2013 we started migrating our legacy application to Ruby on Rails and he fell in love with Ruby and coding in general again.

Through my work experience and other personal projects he was able to teach myself ruby and python. Since he worked with data that was HIPPA compliant, he was not able to use Heroku and was required to build an on premises server that required me to learn other open source technologies like ubuntu/linux, bash scripting, nginx, passenger and postgresql/mysql.

He have been consulting since 2016 and I am now seeking to locate a challenging position in development that will allow me to refine the skills He have already learned, and which will also encourage me to explore new technologies and constantly improve my abilities and skill set.
